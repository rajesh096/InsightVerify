These documents, generally available in image or PDF form, may be in languages other than Hindi or English. In order to verify the information filled by applicants in their biodata applications can be verified using Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) techniques involving Machine Learning Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, etc. Expected Solution: The extraction of information from submitted documents can take place at the time of application form submission and alerting applicant in case of any mismatch. Thereafter, while screening of applications more robust data extraction techniques may be employed to further avoid any chances of error.
